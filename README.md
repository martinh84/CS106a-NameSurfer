Part of the Stanford University Computer Science Programming Methodology course

This Assignment was created as part of the course, credit to Eric Roberts.

Intro to the Assignment:
This assignment has two primary goals. The first is to give you an opportunity to use Java interactors to create an application that looks more like a modern interactive
program complete with buttons, text fields, and a resizable graphical display. The second goal is to pull together the various facilities you have learned about so far to create an interesting application that—unlike Breakout, Hangman, and Yahtzee—is not a game but rather a useful program that presents data on some fascinating sociological questions.

Summary:
This program displays the distribution of names chosen for children over the last 100 years in the United States This program takes data from a .txt file and, depending on the user input, displays it in a graph.

I went a little further than the original task, adding code to adjust the displaying of data, thus improving the user experience.  The amending of the placement of GLabels, depending if the names ranking was on the increase, or not, added more complexity but also made the finished result look much better.

This is using an older version of Java, with libraries that were relevant at the time (Stanford course was early 2000's).  However, this was still a good challenge to get stuck into and helping to build my knowledge with Java.
